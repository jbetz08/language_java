# Overview

This program was to help me get used to the syntax of Java since it is a commonly used 
language in the industry. I wanted to get used to using classes and receiving input from the user in Java.
An accomplishment I made was learning how IntelliJ IDE helps when writing software and classes in Java.

I wrote a very simple translation software. It currently only translates the word "Hello" in 5 fun languages
that I included as classes: 
1.German
2.French
3.Italian
4.Spanish
5.Portuguese

I used IntelliJ IDEA 

I used Java along with the Scanner library to receive input

# Future Work

* Add more languages
* Connect to a translation API to take this to a new level
* Add more words to translate
