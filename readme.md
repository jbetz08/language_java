# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  
Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

This program was to help me get used to the syntax of Java since it is a commonly used 
language in the industry. I wanted to get used to using classes and receiving input from the user in Java.
An accomplishment I made was learning how IntelliJ IDE helps when writing software and classes in Java.

{Provide a description the software that you wrote to demonstrate the Java language.}
I wrote a very simple translation software. It currently only translates the word "Hello" in 5 fun languages
that I included as classes: 
1.German
2.French
3.Italian
4.Spanish
5.Portuguese

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I used IntelliJ IDEA 

I used Java along with the Scanner library to receive input

# Useful Websites

* [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/)
* [W3 Schools - Java](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_user_input.asp)

# Future Work

* Add more languages
* Connect to a translation API to take this to a new level
* Add more words to translate
